# Interactive Checklist App

## Overview
This is a simple and interactive **web-based checklist application** that allows users to:

- Add checklist items
- Toggle items as complete
- Swap the position of two items interactively
- Persist checklist state in the browser using `localStorage`

The app is built with **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** and demonstrates modular code structure.

- **Toggle completion:** Click on an item to mark it complete (`âœ…`) or incomplete.
- **Swap items:** Select two items to swap their positions; the swap button highlights selected items in orange.
- **Persistent storage:** All items and their checked state are saved in `localStorage` and restored on page reload.
- **Clean and modular code:** Written in separate JS modules (`Checklist`, `Item`, `DataHandler`) for maintainability.
